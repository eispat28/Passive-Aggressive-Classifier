# Passive-Aggressive-Classifier
Implementing a Passive Aggressive Classifier to Detect Fake News Articles 

The Passive Aggressive Algorithm works like so:
- Passive: If the prediction is correct, keep the model and do not make any changes. 
- Aggressive: If the prediction is incorrect, make changes to the model. 

Working with a data set of +6,000 news articles labelled as either REAL or FAKE, we want to train the Passive Aggressive Classifier to automatically classify articles.
The results of the classification on the test set were measured using a confusion matrix
